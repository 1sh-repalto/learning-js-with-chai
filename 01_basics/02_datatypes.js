// max value a number can hold is 2^1023 Ã— (2 - 2-52). Values higher than this are replace with special vlaue "Infinity".
// Integer range -> -2^53 + 1 to 2^53 - 1

// string -> ""

// boolean -> true/false

// null -> value exists but has no "meaning", typeof null is object

// undefined -> value doesn't exist, typeof -> undefined

// symbol -> unique

// Note - JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that data types of variables are determined by the value they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them.
